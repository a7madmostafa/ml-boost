It it does not seem that `w0` is being updated, but it is, just slowly. `w1` is multiplied by $x_1$ which is the square footage of houses in the dataset, a value in the thousands. This makes `w1` update much more quickly than `w0`. Review the update equations (4) and (5) above. With alpha = 1.0e-7, it will take many iterations to update `w0` to the right value. \n",

The update for `w1` is so large that the cost is larger on each iteration rather than smaller.  If you run it long enough, you will generate a numerical overflow (try it). The lecture described this scenario. \n",

It involves _scaling_ or _normalizing_ the features in the data set so they fall within the same range. Once the data is normalized, alpha will impact all features evenly.\n",
